# RAG Project

Welcome to the repository for the RAG project, a project that utilizes a combination of cutting-edge technologies to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR), text embedding, and search functionality. This project is powered by Python, FastAPI, Microsoft AI, Docker, Vector DB, and OpenAI.

## Project Overview

The RAG project is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of various technologies to efficiently process, analyze, and search text data. It employs a wide array of technologies to deliver a comprehensive solution for OCR, text embedding, and search.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language for the project.
- **FastAPI:** A modern web framework for building high-performance APIs.
- **Microsoft AI:** Microsoft's AI services are leveraged for various AI-related tasks within the project.
- **Docker:** Containerization technology used for deploying and managing the project's environment.
- **Vector DB:** A database designed for managing vector data, used for efficient text embedding and similarity search.
- **OpenAI:** Utilized for advanced AI capabilities, such as natural language processing and machine learning.

## Features

- **OCR:** Optical Character Recognition is used to extract text from images or scanned documents.
- **Text Embedding:** The project embeds extracted text into vector representations for efficient processing.
- **Search:** Leveraging vector data, the project allows for powerful and efficient text searching.
